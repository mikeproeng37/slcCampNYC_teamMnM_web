Parent teacher communication

===================


This application facilitates communication between the 
teacher and the parent. On the teacher side, this web app
allows the teacher do the following: 

1) View a list of her classes and the students in each class.
2) Grade student assessments and assignments
3) Assign homework to a class
4) Create a school event that parents will see in their feeds
5) Write notes about students and share these notes with parents

The parent application is a mobile app that will be able to access
all these pieces of information about his children.
